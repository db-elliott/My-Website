      "contents": "\r\nI graduated magna cum laude from Arizona State University in 2020. My Bachelor’s degree in Biological Sciences focused on conservation biology and ecology. During my undergraduate career, I investigated how climate change may affect the development and behavior of agricultural pests. This led to my initial interest in environmental conservation. I later interned in the Marine Biology Department at the University of Connecticut. In their fish ecology lab, I explored whether the accumulation of heavy metals in fish could provide insight into the health of trophic webs. This experience led to my passion for combining ecological and political knowledge to improve ocean protections. I also consider indigenous stewardship an important and underutilized aspect of the conservation conversation. Ultimately, I desire to develop fiscally feasible and community-oriented methods of ocean conservation while specializing in Economics and Politics of the Environment at the Bren School.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Water level (in feet above sea level) of Mono Lake, a terminal saline lake in Lee Vining, CA, measured annually from 1850 - 2017. The blue line shows lake level, red points show important events in the recent history of Mono Lake, and dashed lines represent important water levels.\r\nA Time Series Visualization for Willamette Falls Fish Ladder\r\nOverview\r\nThis report explores the timing of adult fish passage through the Willamette Falls fish ladder on the Willamette River in Oregon. We focus on three species: coho salmon, jack coho samon, and steelhead trout. Time series data from the Columbia River Data Access in Real Time project is used to create visualizations for daily counts, seasonality trends, and annual counts of each species for the years 2001-2010.\r\n\r\n Willamette Falls Fish Ladder, 1913. Source: OldOregonPhotos.com\r\n\r\n Source: US Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District Website\r\n\r\nData Source: Columbia River DART (Data Access in Real Time), 2010.

Daily passage counts. Counts for three species of fish–Coho, Jack Coho, and Steelhead–passing through the Willamette Falls fish ladder are shown daily for the years 2001-2010.\r\n\r\nTake-Aways:\r\nSteelhead counts are generally the highest of the three species.\r\nThere seems to be a seasonal pattern, as more pass through the ladder at certain times of year, but there does not seem to be an overall trend to the actual number that do so.\r\n\r\nCoho counts usually fall between steelhead and jack coho, excepting a few points, mainly two huge spikes in 2010.\r\nJack coho counts are generally the lowest of the three species.\r\n\r\nSeasonplots\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2. Monthly Average Passage. Average counts for three species of fish–Coho, Jack Coho, and Steelhead–passing through the Willamette Falls fish ladder are shown monthly for the years 2001-2010.\r\n\r\nTake-Aways:\r\nCoho and jack coho have similar seasonality, with passage occurring from the end of summer to the beginning of winter (concentrated in fall).\r\nTheir peaks of activity generally look to be from September to October.\r\n\r\nSteelhead have a much broader stretch of activity, from January to June (midwinter to midsummer).\r\nTheir peak of activity generally looks to be from May to June.\r\n\r\n2009 and 2010 were unusually productive years for coho salmon.\r\n\r\nAnnual Counts by Species\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3. Annual Passage Count. Annual counts for three species of fish–Coho, Jack Coho, and Steelhead–passing through the Willamette Falls fish ladder are shown for the years 2001-2010.\r\n\r\nTake-Aways:\r\nSteelhead counts are generally much higher than either of the other two species, but the actual number of fish passing through is rather unpredictable year-to-year.\r\nCoho counts are relatively stable until they hit a massive peak in the later years of the dataset.\r\nJack coho counts are very low and stay consistent over the life of the data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
